## About me
I’m Vaishnav Raja, a Boston-based mechatronics/robotics engineer who likes taking ideas all the way to working software-Perseption, RL and hardware—CAD, PCB, firmware, control, and tests that hold up in front of people. I’ve built AGVs with pick-to-light and stock tracking at Accenture (Best Innovator Award), IoT inventory systems, a SAE BAJA ATV (state runner-ups), and integrations on KUKA and Mitsubishi arms. On the perception side, I’ve worked on 6-DoF pose for bin-picking and robustness for ORB-SLAM3; on the learning side, I’ve trained RL agents for goal-directed navigation.

I care about work with real impact: hands-on builds, measurable results, and frequent demos. I’m comfortable in ambiguous, fast-paced R&D—balancing analysis, design, rapid prototyping, and software integration to get credible results quickly.

Beyond robotics, I’m not always the first to start a chat, but once we get going, I’m all in. I enjoy playing basketball, climbing, motorbiking, and trying new activities.
<!-- These activities keep me creative and resilient — qualities I bring into engineering challenges.   -->
